Based off of the chart "Total Fare by City Type", it can be seen that on average Urban areas tend to spend more money on ride share. While suburban areas spend around half of that, and rural areas spend about a a third of suburban areas.

Looking at the "Pyber Summary Table" Urban areas use ride share the most, while having th lowest fare of the three areas. Followed by Suburban and then Rural respectively. 

##Summary
In conclusion I would recommend three solutions to imporve access and affordabilty in the various city types. The first solution would be to lower pricing in Rural areas. This could incentivise residents in the area to use ride sharing more. The second solution would be to offer discounts for travel to the urban areas from the Suburbs and more Rural areas. This could help increase told rides in all three types of cities, by allowing more people access to conveint transportation. Th final solution would be to work with the city developers to help create more developments in rural areas. If rural areas have more attractions that could increase population and also tourism in the area. The increase in traffic could allow for a increase in total rides and help lower the average fare and make ride sharing more affordable in the are.
